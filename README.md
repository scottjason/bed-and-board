Bed and Board

A scraper that crawls airbnb's site for hosts. Using Google's AutoCompelete API, a user can enter their location as well as their checkin and checkout date. On submit, the page renders location, images, ratings and more.

Bed and Board is fully responsive and mobile-ready.

Stack is Angular.js, Express.js, Node.js
Styling is done in plain CSS (aside from jQuery's datepicker)

Airbnb does not offer a public api. This is a portfolio project and not for commercial use.
